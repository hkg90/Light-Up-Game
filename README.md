This program uses PySimpleGUI to run the GUI interface for the user to play
 the game. If you want to change game board, you need to manually change in board_functions.py
 the file name that's automatically loaded into the game (line 9).
 
 Install PySimpleGUI:
 - In your Shell command prompt input the following to install PySimpleGUI: 
 $ python -m pip install pysimplegui


 I ran this program locally on my computer using version 3.8.8 of python.
 Run the program (program requires at least version 3 of Python):
 $ python lightUp.py
 
 
 Note: It usually takes less than 40 and 20 seconds respectively to solve board1.txt and
 board2.txt.
